# env-sound-svm
a supervised machine learning model that classifies environmental sounds (such as rain, thunder etc.) using Support Vector Machines and kernel-based feature transformations.  Instead of using DNNs, this project leverages audio feature extraction (MFCCs, spectral features, chroma) and SVM’s mathematical rigor to recognize sound classes
